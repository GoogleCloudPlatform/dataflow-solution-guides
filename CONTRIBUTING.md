# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Quality Checks

### For Python code

You normally will write Python code in a subdirectory of the `pipelines` folder. 
Install `yapf` and run the following command in the top level directory of your
 pipeline, to reformat your code:

```shell
 yapf -i -r --style yapf .
 ```

 If you install `pylint`, you can check if your code will pass the build with the 
 following command:

 ```shell
pylint --rcfile ../pylintrc .
```

Please note that the configuration file `../pylintrc` is located in the
 `pipelines` folder.

 ### For Java code

 TBD

 ### For Terraform code

 Run the following command in the top level directory where your Terraform code is located:

 ```shell
 terraform fmt
 ```
