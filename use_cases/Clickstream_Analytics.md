# Clickstream analytics

In the fast-paced digital landscape, understanding user behavior is crucial for optimizing websites, apps,
and marketing campaigns. Clickstream analytics provides a continuous stream of data on how users interact
with digital platforms. But to truly capitalize on this information, businesses need insights in real time,
not days later.

Please refer to **FIXME** for the full version of this solution guide.

## Assets included in this repository

- [Terraform code to deploy a project for Clickstream Analytics](../terraform/clickstream_analytics/)
- [Sample pipeline in Java for clickstream analytics with Dataflow](../pipelines/clickstream_analytics_java/)

## Technical benefits

Dataflow provides a robust platform for building and scaling real-time clickstream analytics solutions.
Key capabilities make it the ideal choice for extracting maximum value from user interaction data:

- Streamlined Clickstream Processing: Dataflow's Apache Beam SDK simplifies the development of complex
  clickstream pipelines. Pre-built transforms, state management, and windowing functions make it easy to
  aggregate, filter, and enrich clickstream events in real time.
- Clickstream Enrichment: Enrich raw clickstream data with external data sources (e.g., user demographics,
  product catalogs) to gain deeper insights into user behavior and preferences. Side inputs and joins in
  Dataflow enable seamless data enrichment within your pipelines.
- Real-Time Dashboards and Alerts: Integrate Dataflow with real-time visualization tools and alerting systems
  to monitor clickstream metrics, detect anomalies, and trigger actions based on user interactions. Dataflow's
  low-latency processing ensures that insights are delivered within seconds.
- Scalability and Cost Efficiency: Dataflow automatically scales to handle fluctuating clickstream volumes.
  Pay only for the resources you use, avoiding overprovisioning and unnecessary costs. Right-fitting capabilities
  allow you to allocate resources optimally across different pipeline stages.
- Flexible Deployment: Deploy clickstream pipelines on various infrastructure options, including VMs and serverless
  options like Cloud Run or Cloud Functions. This flexibility allows you to tailor your deployment to your specific
  needs and budget.
- Open-Source Ecosystem: Leverage the power of the Apache Beam ecosystem, including a vast library of I/O
  connectors for various data sources and sinks. Dataflow's compatibility with open-source tools ensures flexibility
  and avoids vendor lock-in.
