Welcome to the Dataflow Solution Guides!

The Dataflow Solution Guides offer full end-to-end deployment for the most
common streaming solutions to run
on [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/).

This repository contains the following assets for each guide:

- Full Terraform code to spawn all the necessary Google Cloud infrastructure
- Pipelines code in Python, Java and Go (coming soon) for a
  sample pipeline for each use case
