# ETL / integration

This directory contains the Terraform code to spawn a Google Cloud project
with all the necessary infrastructure and configuration required for running
the ETL / integration solution guide.

These deployment scripts are part of the 
[Dataflow ETL Integration solution guide](../../use_cases/ETL_integration.md).

## Bill of resources created by this script

The scripts will create the following resources

| Resource             |         Name          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Project              |      Set by user      | Optional, you may reuse an existing project. If the project is created by Terraform, it will enable the APIs for Cloud Build, Dataflow,  Monitoring, Pub/Sub, Dataflow Autoscaling, and Artifact Registry                                                                                        |

## How to deploy

1. **Set the configuration variables:**
   - Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` in the current directory.
   - Add the following configuration variables to the file, replacing the values with your own:
     ```
     billing_account = "YOUR_BILLING_ACCOUNT"
     organization = "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID"
     project_create = TRUE_OR_FALSE
     project_id = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
     region = "YOUR_REGION"
     ```
2. **Initialize Terraform:**
   - Run the following command to initialize Terraform:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     ```
3. **Apply the configuration:**
   - Run the following command to apply the Terraform configuration:
     ```bash
     terraform apply
     ```
4. **Wait for the deployment to complete:**
   - Terraform will output the status of the deployment. Wait for it to complete successfully.
5. **Access the deployed resources:** You are now ready to launch the sample pipeline in this solution guide.
